[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findautoware_cmake.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "autoware_cmake", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "autoware_cmake"
  with any of the following names:

    autoware_cmakeConfig.cmake
    autoware_cmake-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "autoware_cmake" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "autoware_cmake_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "autoware_cmake" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
